# OpenAPI Processor

This is a small processor to split the OpenAPI specification in the multiple pieces.

Usage:
```bash
vendor/bin/openapi-processor \
    --srcDir={sources directory} \
    [--output={output file}]
```

By default, the output file is stored in the same folder as the source files.
