          The affiliate factor of the sponsor. The interpretation of the error
          is fully dependent of this number: if it is `0`, it means that the
          sponsor user has not bought anything on our site. If this number is
          `4`, it means that the sponsor has exhausted his affiliates factor
          (currently the maximum is 3).
